title: Formulas in Markdown
date: 2021-02-02

I need to write formulas in markdown. I'll try using the mathjax javascript library. Here are some tests:

I'll try to take the limit of a function:
$$\[\lim_{x\to\4} f(x)\]$$
And now I'll try to display something inline. Maybe I'll define the previously mentioned function as: $$\(f(x) = x^-2 + 2e^x \)$$ and hopefully it will display correctly.

I used the mathjax delimiters: $$ and $$. For the first example I entered:
'''
\[\lim_{x\to\4} f(x)\]
'''
And for the second, I typed:
'''
\(f(x) = x^-2 + 2e^x \)
'''
